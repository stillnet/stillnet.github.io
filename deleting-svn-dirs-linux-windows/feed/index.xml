					<description><![CDATA[@Steve

I&#039;d argue that it&#039;s a delete-existing-right-click op, but that may just be splitting hairs. :-)

You can export from your own working copy or _to_ it?  I know the latter, of course, and the problem is that you may be exporting from a repository to a working directory that has updated code.  That was my concern.  Nonetheless, it&#039;s a 6-of-one-half-dozen-of-the-other thing.  To each his own.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Rob - I use TortoiseSVN, so for me it is a right-click, context menu op.

@Rob,@Ryan - you can direct svn export to pull from the repo or your current working copy. I&#039;ve only ever used it against my current working copy (so I learned something here!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Steve, sometimes you can do an export, but sometimes you can&#039;t.  In my case I was working with files that had come from a backup of a working copy.  The files in the repository were NOT what I needed, I needed the files from the backup of the working copy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Steve

Sure, you could do that, but it seems like a lot more work than right clicking on a parent folder and selecting an option from a context menu. And what if you have changes in your working copy from what&#039;s in the repository?]]></description>
