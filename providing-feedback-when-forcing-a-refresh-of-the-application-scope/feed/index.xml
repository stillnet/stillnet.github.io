					<description><![CDATA[This is a great tip.
I am reasonably new to CF, I am using CF8 for a couple weeks, after coming from an MS environment - learning how CF deals with common scenarios is great.

This is a great tip and it is good to learn that the Macromendia/Adobe guys have got the logic of this kind of HTML Head management sorted for the lifetime of the request.

I would like to add that in order to deliver absolute XHTML and standards compliance in a consistently reliable manner when you are dealing with dynamic pages (I mostly develop web applications as opposed to sites) is to use cfhtmlhead for ALL clients-script activity - instead of just outputing some script as required and have it appear in the repsonse where you made the output, just simply wrap it in this construct and hey presto - the script is where it should be.  Lovely.

Excellent tip - highly recommendable - this is a massive issue for me when dealing with dev, test, stage and live - the ability to reload the application scope in ASP.NET is brilliant - CF lacks this, but this tip makes up for it.

Cheers]]></description>
