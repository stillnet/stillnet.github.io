					<description><![CDATA[I agree, Yoxos is awesome.
I also came across a free product called Pulse, made by the same guys who do MyEclipse.

I actually think it&#039;s superior, since it not only configures downloads, but manages your plugins and makes them sharable easily. Anyway, worth a look for sure. They even have pre-made profiles ready to run for CFEclipse!
