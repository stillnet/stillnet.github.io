					<description><![CDATA[Hi Ryan,

I&#039;m not clear on how to output the returned keys (results). 
 
I&#039;m not clear on the variable scope name to be used (i.e., result, returnedXML, or PaymentGateway).

Using the following:





Would the returned variables be the following:


Result Code: #result.resultcode#
Result Message: #result.message#
Result Message Code: #result.messagecode#
Result Message Text: #result.messagetext#
Result Returned XML: #result.returnedXml#


Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Ryan,

I am gald to have found your programming as it is definitely helping a new CF programmer like me with the project i am working on. I do have a question for you though.

Is there a way to pass the invoice ID, Amount, and Customer ID through the returnedXML? I would like this information to carry through to an additional page that uses this data to query a database, but cannot see a way to extract those variables from the returned XML... Any thoughts?

Here is what I have so far, but sure how to get those variables to carry through Authorize:

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
	
		&lt;!--- remove the BOM (byte order mark) from the resulting content, if it exists --&gt;
		
			
		 
		
		
			&lt;!--- will also return the sent orignal xml in case they want to do anything else with it --&gt;
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
				
			
            
Here 	 --&#062;	
				
			
            
Here 	 --&#062;    
				
			
            			
			
				
			
			
			
				
			
				
                                     
			
			
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
			
		

		
	


Thank you for your time. I know that this is an older project of yours, but I would definitely appreciate any help you can give.

					<description><![CDATA[I am passing the form variables into the cfc like you show here:

&#034;
&#060;cfset PaymentGateway = CreateObject(&#034;component&#034;,&#034;AuthorizeNetRecurring&#034;).init(
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;loginname = &#034;AuthNetLoginName&#034;,
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;transactionKey = &#034;YourTransactionKey&#034;,
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;mode = &#034;live or test&#034;)&#062;

&#060;cfinvoke component=&#034;#PaymentGateway#&#034; method=&#034;createSubscription&#034; returnvariable=&#034;result&#034;&#062;
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#060;cfinvokeargument name=&#034;startDate&#034; value=&#034;#DateFormat(Now(),&#034;yyyy-mm-dd&#034;)#&#034;&#062;
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#060;cfinvokeargument name=&#034;customerEmail&#034; value=&#034;#email#&#034;&#062;
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;etc....
&#060;/cfinvoke&#062;&#160;&#160;
&#034;

Are you just passing variables into the cfc differently? Or is this stuff on the page after the cfc has inititated?

Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Chris, your code doesn&amp;apos;t look right, you need to be passing data into the createSubscription() method like

&#060;cfset myObj.createSubscription(startDate = Form.startDate, customerEmail = Form.email, etc...) /&#062;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ok, so they weren&amp;apos;t actually blocking anything. What happened was there was a cftry in there (I didn&amp;apos;t write the code and missed it) and errors weren&amp;apos;t showing up.

It is updating on the authorize.net site!

One final question! What would I use to grab the subscriptionid? returnedxml.subscriptionid and retStruct.subscriptionid and result.subscriptionid don&amp;apos;t work for me! 

I tried your &#060;cfset tmp = MyObj.createSubscription(….. all your data here)&#062;
but wrote it as &#060;cfset tmp = MyObj.createSubscription&#062; and i got the error &#034;CREATESUBSCRIPTION is undefined in MYOBJ.&#034;

Thanks sooooooo much :)]]></description>
