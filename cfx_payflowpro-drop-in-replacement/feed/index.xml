					<description><![CDATA[here is one link of paypal helping my confused head:

here is the other link after I figured it out and posted the steps that worked for me:

I can&amp;apos;t say if this will help with CF5, or if this is really your issue, but last time it &#034;stopped&#034; working .. this was the fix.

good luck.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Chuck:

Have you updated the root certs? That fixed my problem the last time this tag, &#034;stopped&#034; working.&#160;&#160; The only time I&amp;apos;ve seen this tag stop working, is when paypal changes something without telling anyone (like the URL, or requiring the cert update)


Lemme see if I can&amp;apos;t find my post with what I did to update certs.
also running IIS6]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[BradB:&#160;&#160;I had the same issue like you but after multiple call to paypal I managed to fix the problem.&#160;&#160;You need to update the certificate not only in the root but also inside the Coldfusion folder - YOU HAVE TO DO IT IN BOTH PLACES.&#160;&#160;Below is the information they provide in connection with this:

1. Download the certs from VeriSign at 
https://www.verisign.com/support/roots.html

2. Open zip and location the Cert file that needs to be updated. 
In this case the &#034;VeriSign Class 3 - G2&#034;. Take note of it&amp;apos;s location 
on the server. Recommend renaming it to have no spaces and then 
putting it in the &#034;C:\CFusiomMX7\runtime\jre\lib\security&#034; folder.

3. Open command prompt and type &#034;cd c:\CFusionmx7\runtime\jre\bin&#034;
or the location of the &#034;keytool.exe&#034; file and hit enter.
Don&amp;apos;t try to run the keytool.exe without the next step. It won&amp;apos;t
hurt anything, but it won&amp;apos;t do anything either.

4. Now type the following replacing what it necessary
(such as the cert file name from step 2 above and alias name)

keytool -import -trustcacerts - keystore c:/cfusionmx7/runtime/jre/lib/security/cacerts -file c:/cfusionmx7/runtime/jre/lib/security/Class_3_Public_Primary_Certification_Authority_G2.cer -alias VeriSignG2

5. You&amp;apos;ll be prompted for a password and as long as you haven&amp;apos;t
ever changed it, it should be &#034;changeit&#034;, which is the default.

6. You&amp;apos;ll be prompted to approve the request. Type &#034;yes&#034; 
without the quotes and hit enter

7. A bunch of text should appear validating the installation. If you 
get an error, make sure your path and file names are correct in
the step above.

8. To verify, go to the jre\lib\security directory in Windows Explorer
and make sure the files modified date is today&amp;apos;s date.

Hope this will help.

Thanks,

Eleni]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Ryan and ben.&#160;&#160;It clearly seems to be related to the cert update, though so far the G2 update (I am also the host) does not seem to resolve the problem.&#160;&#160;The folks at Paypal seem to be willing to reluctanty admit an issue, but appear to have no method of resolution.&#160;&#160;It may be complicated by the fact that I buy my certs from Comodo and there are G2 root certs from different authorities (Verisign, Thawte, etc.) but Comodo does not seem to even understand what they are and I&amp;apos;m haing trouble getting a Comodo root kit that is compatible with the new Paypal system.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[in response to BradB.

Paypal just updated their root SSL certificates a few days ago, and it screwed a lot of folks up. Ryan&amp;apos;s tag still works fine, its just that your host may need to update their root certs and add them to the java keystore in cfmx7.
I had the same issue. it worked fine for years then it failed.

basically, until you update the certs on your machine with at least G2 certs from verisign, paypal won&amp;apos;t answer a http request from coldfusion.

hope that helps]]></description>
