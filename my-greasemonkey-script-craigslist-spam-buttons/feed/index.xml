					<description><![CDATA[Chris, every website that allows user generated content has some type of moderation system.  Sometimes thats paid staff that looks through the content, but often the end users themselves do the moderation.  Almost every single forum, review site, and classified site I visit has some type of &#039;report this&#039; or &#039;mark as inappropriate&#039; button.  What craigslist is doing is not new.  And it works, and most people find it works well.  Without moderation craigslist would be useless, with most of the postings being spam.

Also I don&#039;t think you quite understand the concept of public and private.  Having a sign on your lawn is nothing like having a posting on craigslist.

Now I&#039;m going to disable comments on this post because they are starting to get out of hand.

By the way there should be a new version out of the script in a few days.  :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, one thing I forgot.  Learn to read.  I didn&#039;t say it was a private site, I said it was a privately run site.  learn the difference.  It&#039;s open to public, but the Sysop is running it privately.   Got that?

I doubt it,but anything is worth one good try.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well.  Aren&#039;t you special.

I don&#039;t whine.   And for your information.  I don&#039;t avoid confrontation when it&#039;s called for.   I notice that you&#039;re doing the very thing that you call others out on.  Sitting behind your computer and talking trash with no way to back it up.   You&#039;re so busy finding fault with others you can&#039;t see a tree through the forest.   Sounds to me like you&#039;re doing the whining little boy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have to agree with P.O. and JoeC....
The whiners like Phil, Bob, and Ryan that feel the need to &#039;police&#039; ads are losers with nothing else to do but hide behind their computers.   Would you come up to me at my house if I had a marketing sign on my front lawn that you didn&#039;t agree with, and try to take it down??? No, you sure wouldn&#039;t -  why?? because you&#039;re all sissies that avoid confrontation by hiding at home trying to play internet police.

And before one of you beaks off about &#039;posting on a private site&#039; etc - this isn&#039;t a PRIVATE site.  It seems like  pretty PUBLIC site that you can get to through a google search/link.  If you want to make it private, have a LOGIN requirement]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ryan,

I saw a version 1.2 posted, but it was not working correctly and it&#039;s difficult to tell if v1.1 works because it&#039;s using the incorrect URL for flagging.

I&#039;ve fixed it properly so that it gets the city and constructs the correct URL for flagging.

Let me know if you&#039;d like a copy to post.

					<description><![CDATA[This isn&#039;t a script but it makes the process of flagging multiple spam or prohibited ads easier by using a typical CL search query.  IMO a needed tool to fend of the tide of spam/scams flowing in from China.  One should also send an email to spam@craigslist.org to report the offenders.

					<description><![CDATA[Ryan, I gotta ask you: is this thing working, or not?  Because CL NYC is overwhelmed with Chinese spam --- like a thousand at a time --- and I&#039;ve been using your script like crazy.  Am I wasting my time?

Thanks for your efforts.]]></description>
