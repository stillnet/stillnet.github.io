I like these because they work regardless of what IDE you use, what operating system, etc. They work from any computer that has internet access. Handy when you are troubleshooting on a remote machine.</p>
<p>Here is one for formatting XML: <a href="http://www.shell-tools.net/index.php?op=xml_format">http://www.shell-tools.net/index.php?op=xml_format</a></p>
<p>And one for JSON from the same site: <a href="http://www.shell-tools.net/index.php?op=json_format">http://www.shell-tools.net/index.php?op=json_format</a></p>
<p>Here is a SQL one that helped me out a lot tonight: <a href="http://www.dpriver.com/pp/sqlformat.htm">http://www.dpriver.com/pp/sqlformat.htm</a></p>
<p>I fed it a horrible looking, very complex query and it made it easily readable. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>This new version works completely differently, it flags items in the background using a hidden iframe.  This should fix the problems people were having with the old version.   Special thanks to Steve Sweet for his help on this version.</p>
<p><del datetime="2008-10-30T02:14:48+00:00">I&#8217;m not 100% sure this is working perfectly yet, so please try it out and let me know what you think.</del></p>
<p>Update 10/29/2008 &#8211; this is now working great!  And it keeps the [spam] links marked as visited, even after reloading the page, so you can see which posts you&#8217;ve already marked.</p>
<p>The latest version can always be downloaded from <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/7399">http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/7399</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend was my annual company dinner.  We had a <i>wonderful</i> meal at Colton&#8217;s Woodfired Grill.  Several awards were handed out, and somehow I was chosen to receive the grand prize &#8211; <em>Uber Geek of the Year</em>.  I was told my achievements that led up to this were:<br />
<span id="more-96"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Always working through a large stack of programming books on my desk</li>
<li>Attending several user groups in the area</li>
<li>Sometimes driving over 100 miles to attend neighboring user groups</li>
<li>Running the Nebraska ColdFusion Users Group</li>
<li>My gadget compulsion &#8211; For the last few months I have been receiving several shipments each week from around the world: HD cameras, RC airplanes, helicopters, batteries, parts, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The trophy was made out of computer parts from the very first servers used when CF WebTools was founded.</p>
<p>This beautiful hand-crafted trophy will sit with pride on my shelf until next year.  I thought about trying to mod it so the fans spin, or the LEDs light up, but I figure that will only guarantee I win this <em>prestigious</em> award again next year&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I published an update to my Craigslist Spam Buttons greasemonkey script. (If you don&#8217;t know what this is about, see my <a href="/2007/02/08/my-greasemonkey-script-craigslist-spam-buttons/">earlier post</a>).  I&#8217;ve had some feedback on the script, and I was able to incorporate those requests.  Now the [spam] buttons are displayed at the front of item link.  <em>And</em> when you click on the link, a request is made in the background to mark the item as spam.  You no longer have to jump to the flag-spam page, then click the continue browsing button to get back to where you were.  Instead the [spam] button changes to a red check mark to indicate that it has been marked.</p>
<p>This is more difficult than you would think, you can&#8217;t just do a simple AJAX request because your browser will only make requests to the same site you are on.  In this case you are browsing on yourcity.craigslist.org, but the flag-spam page is on flag.craigslist.org.</p>
<p>The greasemonkey extension does provide a built in method to make http calls to external sites, but that would break my Opera compatibility.  So instead I load the flag-spam page as the src of a JavaScript-created image object.</p>
<p>It was fun to figure out, I really enjoy programming in JavaScript.</p>
<p>You can get the script from <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/7399">userscripts.org</a>.  Here is a screen shot:</p>
