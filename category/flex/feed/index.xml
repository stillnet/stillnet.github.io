										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When debugging a Flex 3 application on Vista / IE 7, you may encounter this error when debugging an application for the <em>second</em> time.</p>

<p>Even though it appears there are no IE instances still running, this error comes up.</p>
<p>There are several solutions to this, one is to configure Flex Builder to launch a different browser for debugging, such as FireFox.  Another is to disable Vista&#8217;s UAC.  Neither of these were good solutions for me.</p>
<p>The problem has to do with a socket getting left open.  As a short term fix you can use your task manager and kill the <code>ieuser.exe</code> process when you get this error.  Then you should be able to launch the debugger ok.</p>
<p>This bug is discussed in <a href="http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FB-9902">Adobe&#8217;s bug tracker system</a>.  Their suggested solution for now is to add this string to your flexbuilder.ini file:</p>
<p><code> -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true</code></p>
<p>After searching around for a while and not finding my flexbuilder.ini file, I discovered that file only exists if you&#8217;ve installed Flex Builder stand alone.  If you install it as an eclipse plug-in, as I have, then you need to add that line to eclipse.ini.  But that didn&#8217;t solve the problem for me, and I&#8217;ve read it didn&#8217;t solve it for some other people as well.</p>
<p>My solution was to add it to the shortcut I was using to launch Flex Builder.  This solved the problem and I can now debug as many times as I want with no errors.</p>
