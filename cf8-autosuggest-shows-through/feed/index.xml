					<description><![CDATA[This is a good fix for text input fields.
This won&amp;apos;t fix the z order of a cfselect or select input.

A select form input control is presented to the web browser in a different way, if i remember rightly its part of the OS whilst other form controls are generated by the client browser. (Please correct me if i&amp;apos;m wrong).

If there is some magical code to get around this i would be most greatful.

					<description><![CDATA[The users were about to hang me over this issue. I kept telling them that Adobe will fix it. I twice reported this problem as a bug to Adobe for ColdFusion 9.

Though I could not get your script to work, the css example worked fine. Now the users are extremely happy.&#160;&#160;Thanks for this blog entry.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi all,

I don&amp;apos;t know if this will help anyone, but I was having problems with the CF added floats.&#160;&#160;I had three fields in a list intending to have one field below another.&#160;&#160;Because of the CF added floats, they were all on one line.&#160;&#160;I added an &#060;li class=&#034;clear-floats&#034;&#062;&#060;/li&#062; after each datefield cfinput and it cleared up the problem:

.clear-floats {
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;clear: both;
}

I hope it helps someone.]]></description>
