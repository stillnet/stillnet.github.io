					<description><![CDATA[How do I go about upgrading the JVM for coldfusion when I have a later version (1.5) installed on my system. Do I just install over the 1.5? Could I just copy the installation folder without an install so that I don&amp;apos;t overwrite the 1.5?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Ryan!
I&amp;apos;ll try with jre copy approach tonight.
I did try to update jvm.config to point Java 6 which is already installed for other application on that box, but CF MX7 did not start.

Yes, I&amp;apos;m scared to install 2 versions of Java because other app (which is the main app) will not work below Java 6 and we have users on those servers 24/7 and at least 350 users.

I&amp;apos;ll post my update here.
Again Thanks a lot for your quick response, appreciate it.

					<description><![CDATA[Kishor, I installed 1.4.2_11 today on my local machine and only had to restart CF, versus booting the box.&#160;&#160;Trying this in a production environment may not be for the faint of heart, but I thought I&amp;apos;d share my experience, for what it&amp;apos;s worth.&#160;&#160;Good luck!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kishor, you don&amp;apos;t need to reboot after installing a new JVM.&#160;&#160;You WILL need to restart ColdFusion though.

As far as installing two different versions of Java at once, I can&amp;apos;t help you because I&amp;apos;ve never done that.&#160;&#160;I don&amp;apos;t think it would be much of an issue, but I would do it on a test box first.

I think copying over an installed SDK directory from another server would probably work fine, too.&#160;&#160;It should be safe to try it.&#160;&#160;At worst case CF won&amp;apos;t come back up and you&amp;apos;ll need to edit jvm.config to point back to the original JVM and then start again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&amp;apos;ve CF MX7 Server with JVM 1.4.2_05, so now from yesterday we see 1 hr difference (back).
I&amp;apos;m planning to follow the instruction to move to 1.4.2_11.

Platform: Windows 2003
Server: MX7 (Java 1.4.2_05 is packaged within it)
Installed Java: Java 6 - for the other major app running on same boxes.


1. I know once I install 1.4.2_11 I need to boot the box
Problem: I&amp;apos;m NOT allowed to reboot the box.

So if I install 1.4.2_11 on other machine and copy the jre directory to prod box and then change the configuration to point to this jre directory, does it works?

OR do I need to follow the Hot Fix patch.

I prefer not to install 1.4.2_11&#160;&#160;on OS along with Java 6, so How to put this 1.4.2_11 in the CF server MX7?

Thanks for all your time and advice.
